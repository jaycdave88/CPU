Steps to run:

1. cd into the correct Directory where the application lives
2. run command  ' ruby Step_1.rb '
3. A new .txt file will have been made on your Desktop ( CPU_info.txt )
In new terminal window will open in there hit ' Control + C ' to exit program and save data
4. run command ' ruby Step_2.rb ' execute command in original terminal window
5. terminal window will tell you the Average usage of CPU

Program is now finished and NOT saving any data. To rerun application follow above steps again. :)
